# Facial Expression Recognition Using Facial Muscles  
### A Novel Muscle-Driven Computer Vision System (No Training Dataset Required)

This project introduces a **new anatomy-based method** for Facial Expression Recognition (FER).  
Instead of deep-learning classifiers or large emotion datasets, this system focuses on **actual human facial muscles** and their geometric activation.

Using:

- **MediaPipe FaceMesh (468 landmarks)**
- A custom **muscle annotation tool**
- **Vector geometry**
- **Muscle activation physics**

The system produces explainable, muscle-driven emotion detection.

# 🚀 Features

## ✅ Stage 1: Landmark Detection  
- Extract 468 facial landmarks from any image using MediaPipe.
- Draws and saves landmark points for downstream processing.

## ✅ Stage 2: Interactive Muscle Annotation Tool  
A GUI tool where you click on the face to define the muscle regions:

### Currently supported muscles:

### **Upper Face Muscles**
- **Frontalis – Origin (forehead)**  
- **Frontalis – Insertion (eyebrow elevation)**  
- **Orbicularis Oculi (eye ring muscle)**  

### **Mid Face Muscles**
- **Nasalis / Levator Labii Superioris (nose compression / upper lip lift)**  
  → Strong indicator of anger, disgust, or snarl  

### **Lower Face Muscles**
- **Zygomaticus Major – Origin (cheekbone)**  
- **Zygomaticus Major – Insertion (mouth corner for smile)**  
- **Depressor Anguli Oris (mouth corner downward movement for sadness)**  

Each click you make maps the nearest MediaPipe landmark automatically.  
Undo, redo, reset, and per-muscle clearing supported.

Auto-saves to: muscles.py

# 🎨 Stage 3: Muscle Visualization  
The system draws anatomical muscle bands on the input image:

- Origins → Insertions  
- Circular muscles (e.g., Orbicularis Oculi)  
- Direction vectors for contraction  
- Zone highlighting  

Useful for:

- Emotion explanation  
- Visual debugging  
- Muscle-based animation  
- Understanding Action Units (AUs)

---

# 🧠 Stage 4: Muscle Activation Computation  
Each muscle’s "activation" is computed using geometric changes:

- Vector displacement  
- Shortening (contraction)  
- Stretching (relaxation)  
- Angular change  
- Symmetry measurement  

This produces a **muscle activation fingerprint (MAF)** for each face.

---

# 😃 Stage 5: Expression Recognition (Anatomy-Based)

No ML datasets needed — emotions are inferred through muscle signatures:

| Emotion       |           Key Muscles Activated                 |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Happiness** | Zygomaticus Major ↑ + Orbicularis Oculi ↑       |
| **Sadness**   | Depressor Anguli Oris ↑ (mouth pulled downward) |
| **Surprise**  | Frontalis ↑ + Jaw opening                       |
| **Anger**     | Nasalis/LLS ↑ + Eyebrow contraction             |
| **Disgust**   | Nasalis ↑ + Lip lift asymmetry                  |

This makes the system **interpretable**, **scientific**, and **biologically grounded**.
